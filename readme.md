### Resource
Instru is a resource driven sistem in Instruu everything is a resource a resource is a data peace and RDF document a resource can be:
1. Created
2. Deleted
3. Modified
4. Followed
5. Shared
6. Bought (we have defined verbs for all the above activities but this one )


### ownership
By default ownership is of the resource creator. But there are edge situations:
- Creator is working for an institution
- Recorded lesson.
#### Resources types

1. test set 
2. Paper
3. Multimedia
4. Lesson (physical lesson via remote). The thing here is the ownership maybe it is shared between teacher and student/s in different percentages.
